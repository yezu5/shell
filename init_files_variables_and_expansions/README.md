Each time we type a command line and press the enter key, bash performs several processes upon the text before it carries out our command. We have seen a couple of cases of how a simple character sequence, for example “*”, can have a lot of meaning to the shell. The process that makes this happen is called expansion. With expansion, we type something and it is expanded into something else before the shell acts upon it.
